# Data Analysis Using Excel
 In this repo, I will show my some Data Analysis Task Using Excel.

 ### Problem statement

I am given sales data of ***Plexus Biker’s Hub*** [Sales Data.xlsx]. Analyze the data so that they can get some valuable insights that will help them to maximize revenue. 


#### Task 1 - Dataset Preparation
- Sales data from 2011 to 2016 are given in ‘Sales Data’ file. 
- The G Column - ‘Age Group’ is empty. Use formula to derive the age group from the **Customer Age** column. Let's group the customers based on the following criteria:
  
  - Youth (<25)
  - Young Adults (25-34)
  - Adults (35-64)
  - Seniors (>64)
  
- Find out **‘Customer Gender’** using **Index Match** (Not Vlookup).  
- Use formula to derive the month of sales (i.e. January, February) from the **Date** column.
- Add any other column that might be necessary for the analysis. 

#### Task 3 - Pivot table 
Use pivot tables to summarize the data. Do not make more than five tables. 

#### Task 4 - Dashboard
Make an interactive dashboard containing at least 5 to 8 charts. 

#### Task 5 - Insights
Share five insights you’ve found from the analysis. Write them down in the excel sheet.
